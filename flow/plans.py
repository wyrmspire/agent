flow/plans.py - Planning and Prompts

This module handles planning prompts and system instructions.
It tells the model HOW to use tools effectively.

Responsibilities:
- System prompts for tool-using agents
- Planning strategies
- Few-shot examples

Rules:
- Prompts should be clear and concise
- Include examples of good tool usage
- Explain when to use vs not use tools

Your goal is to help the user accomplish their task efficiently.

Guidelines:
1. Think step by step about what the user needs
2. Use tools when you need information or to take actions
3. Answer directly when you already have the information
4. Be concise but thorough
5. If a tool fails, try a different approach or explain the limitation

When using tools:
- Call tools with correct parameters
- Wait for tool results before continuing
- Use tool outputs to inform your final answer
- Don't make assumptions about tool results
