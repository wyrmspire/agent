However, you can easily do this in most programming languages using built-in functions or libraries.\n\nHere's an example of how you could do it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_files(path):\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):\n        for file in files:\n            print(os.path.join(root, file))\n\nlist_files(\".\")\n```\n\nThis script will recursively list all files and directories within the current directory (\".\") and its subdirectories. If you want to list only files in the current directory without recursion, you can use `os.listdir()` instead of `os.walk()`.","name":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_ls_1765630694698","type":"function","function":{"name":"list_files","arguments":"{\"path\": \".\"}"}}],"tool_call_id":null},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0}}
